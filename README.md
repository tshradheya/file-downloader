* The program should extensible to support different protocols
* Some sources might very big (more than memory)
* Some sources might be very slow, while others might be fast
* Some sources might fail in the middle of a download
* We don't want to have partial data in the final location in any case.
* Please also include tests (unit tests, integration tests)
* Note that this is an exercise in Software development, so small details do matter
